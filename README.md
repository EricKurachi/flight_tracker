# flight_tracker
A program that finds cheap flights and sends an SMS when the price is lower than your desired budget.

This flight tracker was made to keep track of flight prices in order for me to find the best and cheapest way to go and
live with my girlfriend that is living in Florian√≥polis - SC, Brazil.

I used free APIs and my own tokens, but anyone can create their accounts and create their tokens to use this flight
tracker.
